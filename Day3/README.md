## What is Environment Management?

- Environment management refers to the process of planning, deploying, configuring, and maintaining the various environments like dev,QA,pre-prod and production in which software applications operate. In the context of software development and IT operations, environments typically refer to different stages in the software development lifecycle, each serving a specific purpose.

## What are Terraform Modules?

- a Terraform module is a reusable and shareable unit of Terraform configuration. Modules enable you to encapsulate infrastructure resources, configurations, and logic into a separate and modular package, making it easier to manage and reuse code across different parts of your infrastructure.
